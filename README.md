# Screen Position Selector

Select positions on the screen using keybindings.

I have an idea to build an application that selects a position on the screen (e.g. a button, a window, drag something on the screen or anywhere on the screen) and automates this with an interface using keybindings that does all the mouse dragging for you.

## Helper Tools

- [Robot JS](https://robotjs.io)
- [xdotool]

## Update!!!
I've decided to discontinue this project because I've found a software that does exactly the same what I would build.
___
[Linux Auto Mouse Click Software](http://www.murguu.com/)

I also provided the linux executable as this probably isn't available anymore on there website. But the windows version still works :)
